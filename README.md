# Personal Budget Tracker DApp

## Project Description

The Personal Budget Tracker DApp is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to manage their personal finances in a secure, transparent, and decentralized manner. Users can track their income and expenses, categorize transactions, and monitor their financial balance without relying on traditional centralized financial institutions or third-party services.

This smart contract provides a foundation for personal financial management while ensuring data privacy and user control over their financial information.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize personal financial management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a:

- **Decentralized** financial tracking system that gives users complete control over their data
- **Transparent** platform where all transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain
- **Secure** environment that eliminates single points of failure and reduces data breach risks
- **Accessible** solution that works globally without geographical restrictions
- **Privacy-focused** application where users maintain ownership of their financial data

We aim to empower individuals to take control of their financial lives through Web3 technology, providing them with tools that are both powerful and user-owned.
